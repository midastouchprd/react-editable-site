# react-editable-site

## Why?
I want to create a way to build unique and robust websites for people but not have to handle simple changes like copy and updating photos.

## How?
Creating a SSR Isomorphic-App where we keep a copy of the state in a database that copies to the redux store keeping the state of the website.  That way when the owner of the site needs to update a price she can live edit it instead of having to redeploy the entire app to change 2 characters.

## When? 
Hoping to launch my first site using this early 2018
